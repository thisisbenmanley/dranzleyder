# The Dranzleyder

My first browser extension, [live at the Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dranzleyder/dehjhkmplllpoobjdbaefnacnpalfbpn)!

It's Simple&trade; enough - text nodes are selected from the DOM, and every word is translated independently. Each word in each node is translated into its [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) (IPA) spelling, and each IPA character within the word is replaced with its "dranzleyduhd" version.

## Example - Rick Astley's Wikipedia Page
